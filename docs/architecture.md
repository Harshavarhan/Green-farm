# Green Farm Architecture

## System Overview
Green Farm is a comprehensive farming management system that combines AI-powered pest detection, weather monitoring, and soil moisture analysis. The system uses a microservices architecture with both Python and Java backends, and a React frontend.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend (React)
- **Technology Stack**: React.js, Material-UI, Redux
- **Key Features**:
  - Interactive dashboard for farm monitoring
  - Real-time weather data visualization
  - Pest detection image upload interface
  - Soil moisture tracking graphs
  - User authentication and profile management

### 2. Python Backend (FastAPI)
- **Primary Responsibilities**:
  - AI-powered pest detection using OpenCV
  - Image processing and analysis
  - Weather data integration
  - Real-time data processing
- **Key Components**:
  - `/pest_detection`: AI models for pest identification
  - `/weather`: Weather data aggregation and forecasting
  - `/soil_moisture`: Soil health analysis
  - `/auth`: User authentication and authorization

### 3. Java Backend (Spring Boot)
- **Primary Responsibilities**:
  - Data persistence and business logic
  - User management
  - Report generation
  - Historical data analysis
- **Key Components**:
  - `com.farming.model`: Data models and entities
  - `com.farming.service`: Business logic implementation
  - `com.farming.controller`: REST API endpoints

### 4. Database Layer
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL
- **Key Schemas**:
  ```sql
  - users
  - farm_data
  - pest_detection_history
  - weather_data
  - soil_moisture_readings
  ```

## Data Flow
1. User interacts with React frontend
2. Frontend makes API calls to appropriate backend:
   - Image processing → Python Backend
   - Data persistence → Java Backend
3. Python Backend processes AI-related tasks
4. Java Backend handles data storage and retrieval
5. Both backends communicate with PostgreSQL database

## Security Architecture
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- Encrypted data transmission

## Integration Points
1. **Weather API Integration**
   - External weather data providers
   - Real-time weather updates
   
2. **AI Model Integration**
   - OpenCV for image processing
   - Machine learning models for pest detection
   
3. **Sensor Integration**
   - Soil moisture sensors
   - Temperature sensors
   - Humidity sensors

## Deployment Architecture
- Containerized deployment using Docker
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions/Jenkins
- Scalable cloud infrastructure
- Load balancing and high availability
